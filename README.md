Work in progress...

## Disclaimer
This is my first time developing a game with a game engine and my first time using Godot. Everything you see is me learning.
The current state is just a messy foundation which IÂ´ll clean up and built upon developing the game further.

# Tiufal
This game was created for [Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com) 55 with the theme of Summoning. In this game you play a little demon who got caught by humans. In spectacle for the masses your head is on the chopping block. Using your demonic powers you summon black maigc to free yourself and punish your abductors. Tiufal is about movement inspired by Warstride Challenges and is stylistic based on Doom64.
